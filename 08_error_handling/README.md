# 08_error_handling

## Tasks

In [`src/main.rs`](./08_error_handling/src/main.rs), edit the `goal1`, `goal2`,
and `goal3` function bodies and signatures in order to make them return a
`Result` instead of panicking. Edit `main` to use these new functions.

## Grading

Your code will be evaluated on whether or not running [`test.sh`](./08_error_handling/src/main.rs)
succeeds; that is, your code compiles without warnings and passes all test
cases.

Once you have confirmed your code is good, turn in just the `main.rs` file to
Gradescope.
